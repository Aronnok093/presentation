TensorFlow: As mentioned earlier, TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a wide range of 
tools and libraries for building and deploying machine learning models, with a focus on deep learning. TensorFlow offers a flexible and scalable
platform for developing various types of machine learning algorithms and models.

Keras: Keras is a high-level neural network API that provides a user-friendly interface for building and training deep learning models. It can be
used as a standalone library, but it is also integrated into TensorFlow as its official high-level API. Keras simplifies the process of defining 
neural network architectures by providing modular building blocks and abstracting away low-level implementation details.

Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python. It provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for tasks such as 
classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Scikit-learn is built on top of other scientific libraries, such as NumPy 
and SciPy, and it offers a consistent API and a wealth of functionality for traditional machine learning tasks.

XGBoost: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an open-source library that focuses on gradient boosting algorithms. It is known for its efficiency 
and performance in handling structured data and has gained popularity in various machine learning competitions. XGBoost supports both classification 
and regression tasks and provides additional advanced features like regularization and parallel processing.

DeepVariant: DeepVariant is a tool developed by Google for variant calling in genomic sequencing data. It uses deep learning techniques to identify 
genetic variations from DNA sequencing data with high accuracy. DeepVariant has been widely used in genomics research and has demonstrated significant 
improvements in identifying genetic variations compared to traditional methods.

Genetic Association Database (GAD): The Genetic Association Database is a comprehensive repository of genetic association studies. It collects and
curates information about genetic variants and their associations with different traits, diseases, and phenotypes. GAD provides a valuable resource
for researchers studying the genetic basis of various traits and diseases.

GeneMANIA: GeneMANIA is a web-based tool that helps researchers analyze and interpret gene function and relationships. It integrates various data sources,
including protein-protein interactions, co-expression, genetic interactions, pathways, and more, to generate networks of genes with similar functions or 
shared characteristics. GeneMANIA assists in identifying candidate genes, functional annotations, and potential interactions for further investigation.
